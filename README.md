### Project Data for the VIP HPC Project, Fall 2024
In this repo, you will find results for quantum machine learning (QML) using HPC computing resources provided by the NYU VIP HPC team, guided by Dr. Zongrui Pei.

For much of the material in this repository, I referenced IBM Qiskit's [machine learning tutorials](https://qiskit-community.github.io/qiskit-machine-learning/)

Note that the time of the experiment, the Qiskit machine learning tutorial was on version 0.7.9

My exploration concerns with prediction of stacking fault energies (SFE) of elements based on their physical properties: electron negativity, bulk modulus, and volume in cubic angstrom. We tried two existing Qiskit quantum machine learning algorithms: QVSR and VQR, and recorded the average test accuracy under different hyperparameter settings. 

The details for each method can be found in the sub folders, and the average test accuracy will be included in 'accuracy.csv'.
